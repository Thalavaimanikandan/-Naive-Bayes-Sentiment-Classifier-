# Naive Bayes Sentiment Classifier

A simple implementation of a Naive Bayes sentiment classifier in Python.  
It computes word probabilities from a training dataset and predicts sentiment (positive or negative) of new texts.

---

## Features

- Train on labeled text data  
- Compute prior and conditional probabilities with smoothing  
- Predict sentiment for new sentences  
- Serialize/deserialize model (optional)  

---

## File Structure

- `Naive_trained.py` — main code for training & classification  
- `dataset.json` — sample dataset (training texts + labels)  
- (Optionally) `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `tests/`, `examples/`  

---

## Installation & Requirements

- Python 3.6+  
- (Optional) Any dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt`  

To install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in `dataset.json` (or another format): each item should have text and label.

2. Run training script:

   ```bash
   python Naive_trained.py --train dataset.json
   ```

3. Predict sentiment for new text:

   ```bash
   python Naive_trained.py --predict "I love this product!"
   ```

4. Optionally save and load the trained model.

---

## Example

```bash
$ python Naive_trained.py --train dataset.json
Training complete.

$ python Naive_trained.py --predict "This movie is amazing!"
Predicted sentiment: Positive
```

## Limitations & Future Work

* Assumes independence between words (standard Naive Bayes limitation)
* Doesn’t handle negation or context well
* You can extend by using n‑grams, feature selection, or more advanced NLP models

---

## Tests & Validation

You can include a `tests/` folder with unit tests to verify:

* Probability computations
* Predictions on known examples
* Edge cases (empty text, unknown words)

Run tests using:

```bash
pytest
```

or

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! You can help by:

* Adding better preprocessing (tokenization, stopwords)
* Supporting multi‑class sentiment (positive / neutral / negative)
* Improving model serialization or integrating with more data
* Writing more tests
